                        <p>In my academic journey, I have always dealt with computer related courses at a tertiary level. 
                            I took a short Computer Technician (CompTIA A+) course at Boston City Campus,
                             so I could have the ability to work with the hardware of computers 
                             and understand its components. 
                             I also did a computer skills course where I got to learn how to work with Microsoft Office and finally, at Rhodes University, where I studied Computer Science. I found programming intriguing and a very useful skill for me to have.
                              Java, C++ and Python are among the languages we were taught, including Web Development. </p>

                        <p>I hold a Bachelor of Arts degree in Computer Science from Rhodes University. I am currently unemployed but I am working 
                            on side projects to get a bit of practical experience and most importantly apply the skills and the knowledge I gained in my academic journey. A Tic Tac Toe game and a Weather Web application are 
                            the 2 projects I have worked on so far. I am always willing and eager to learn something new as the tech industry is always evolving and that will provide an
                            opportunity for career growth. 
                            Currently, I am learning how to work with React, my aim is to always learn and contribute to new projects, that will also help me evolve as a professional
                            and adapt to different environments.

                                <h3 class="gameName">Tic Tac Toe</h3>
                                <p>I developed this Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS and implemented its functionality
                                    with JavaScript. It is a 2 player game which has a hover effect that shows whose turn 
                                    it is to play. Once the game is finished either via a win or a draw, a restart butt
                                    on pops up,
                                    which resets the game.

                                <p>I developed this weather app using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. CSS was used mainly to implement the style 
                                    of the app, the functionality is implemented with JavaScript. I used a weather API to be able to access 
                                    the locations that can be found through the search button. The app also shows the details of the weather condition
                                    such as the humidity, wind speed and cloud cover.
